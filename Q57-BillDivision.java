bonAppetit Function:

bonAppetit accepts three parameters: bill (a list of integers representing costs), k (the index of the item Anna did not eat), and b (the amount Brian charged Anna).
It calculates totalBill by summing up all items in bill except the one at index k.
Computes annaShare as half of totalBill.
Compares b with annaShare:
If they are equal, prints "Bon Appetit".
Otherwise, prints the difference b - annaShare, which is the amount Brian owes Anna.
Main Method (Solution class):

Reads input using BufferedReader.
Parses the number of items n and index k from the first line.
Reads the bill as a list of integers from the second line.
Parses the amount b Brian charged Anna from the third line.
Calls Result.bonAppetit with the parsed inputs.
Closes the BufferedReader after processing.
This Java solution effectively handles the problem as specified, ensuring correct calculation and output based on the input provided.

Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the problem in clear language:

Problem Description: Splitting the Bill

Anna and Brian went out for dinner and want to split the bill based on what they ate. Brian received the bill and calculated how much Anna owes him. You need to verify if his calculation is correct or if he owes Anna some money.

Input:

The first line contains two integers, n and k.

n: Number of items ordered.
k: The zero-based index of the item that Anna did not eat.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the cost of each item in the order.

The third line contains an integer b, which is the amount of money Brian charged Anna.

Output:

If Brian's calculation is correct (i.e., Anna owes exactly half of the total bill minus the cost of the item she didn't eat), print "Bon Appetit".
If Brian overcharged Anna, print the difference between what Brian charged (b) and what Anna actually owes.
Explanation:

Anna and Brian split the bill for all items except one (bill[k]), which Anna didn't eat.
The total bill is calculated by summing all items in the bill.
Anna's share of the bill is half of the total bill minus the cost of bill[k].
Compare Brian's charge (b) with Anna's share:
If they are equal, output "Bon Appetit".
If they differ, output the amount Brian owes Anna (if negative, it means Brian overcharged Anna).
Example:

Input:

4 1
3 10 2 9
12
Here, n = 4, k = 1, bill = [3, 10, 2, 9], and b = 12.
Anna didn't eat item at index 1 (10).
Total bill is 3 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 24.
Anna's share should be 24 - 10 = 14, and half of this is 7.
Brian charged Anna 12.
Since 12 is less than 14, Brian should refund 14 - 12 = 2 to Anna.
Output:

2
This problem revolves around basic arithmetic and conditional checks to determine if a bill split was fair or if an adjustment (refund) is needed. Implementing the solution involves understanding how to calculate totals, shares, and making simple comparisons in a programming language like Java or Python
