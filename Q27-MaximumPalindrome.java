Madam Hannah Otto, the CEO of Reviver Corp., is fond of palindromes, or words that read the same forwards or backwards. She thinks palindromic brand names are appealing to millennials.

As part of the marketing campaign for the company's new juicer called the Rotator™, Hannah decided to push the marketing team's palindrome-searching skills to a new level with a new challenge.

In this challenge, Hannah provides a string  consisting of lowercase English letters. Every day, for  days, she would select two integers  and , take the substring  (the substring of  from index  to index ), and ask the following question:

Consider all the palindromes that can be constructed from some of the letters from . You can reorder the letters as you need. Some of these palindromes have the maximum length among all these palindromes. How many maximum-length palindromes are there?

For example, if ,  and , then we have,
