You go to your relative's house with your parents and relatives to check your skills by giving a coding problem. You have to solve the given problem to show you are intelligent. They give you two integers A and B and ask to print prime numbers between A and B (inclusive).

Input Format

First line contains the T- number of test cases. Second line contains A and B.

Constraints

0<=T<=200; 0<=A <=B<=10000

Output Format

Print prime number between A and B.


/*
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = scanner.nextInt(); // Number of test cases

        while (T-- > 0) {
            int A = scanner.nextInt();
            int B = scanner.nextInt();

            for (int i = A; i <= B; i++) {
                if (isPrime(i)) {
                    System.out.print(i + " ");
                }
            }
        }

        scanner.close();
    }

    // Function to check if a number is prime
    static boolean isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
